Hi, my name is Ricky Thomas and I may get a little obsessive over subjects im intrigued with and am very happy its been coding for about a year now. Ive mostly studied web development not as much because im as interested in it as I felt like it would be easier to learn than software development. If im being tottaly honest though software development with all the unique solutions to problems and the thought of working on a program that potentially millions of people may use just fascinates me so very much. I really wann get to a point that im an excellent programmer and have at least a couple simple games as side projects. I have studied html and css some but javascript quite a bit, Python some at first but as much as languages like c# seemed intimadating at first im so very grateful that ive begun studying what is to me a more complex language. I Cannot wait to see where my coding skills are in another year or what im able to acclomplish in another ten years.
